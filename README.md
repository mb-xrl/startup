# Nexa ⚡ — Realtime Workspace for Companies

A production-grade, fully-realtime team collaboration platform:
fast file transfer, WhatsApp-style team chat, projects & kanban tasks, role-based access, presence & live notifications — all updating instantly over WebSockets.

> Vercel-inspired dark/light theme · Hand-rolled SVG icon system (no icon fonts, no hardcoded CDNs) · Mobile-ready layout · JWT auth · SQLite persistence · Drag-and-drop uploads

## Features

- 🔐 **Auth & roles** — Register / login with JWT. First user is owner; owners/admins can create custom roles with fine-grained permissions (`projects.write`, `tasks.write`, `chat.write`, `files.write`, `members.manage`).
- 💬 **WhatsApp-style chat** — Global + per-project channels, typing indicators, presence dots, grouped messages, enter-to-send, optimistic send.
- 📁 **Fast file transfer** — Drag-and-drop uploads, streaming downloads, per-project file spaces, progress feedback, up to 500 MB per file.
- 📋 **Projects & tasks** — Create projects with colors & members; kanban board with todo / in-progress / done columns; drag-and-drop between columns; assign tasks; one-click "done"; optimistic updates.
- ⚡ **Realtime everywhere** — WebSocket bus broadcasts messages, task changes, file uploads, member join/leave, notifications with toasts. No polling.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — Inbox with unread counts; auto-cleared when read; "mark all as read".
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** — Vercel-inspired theme, perfect dark + light modes, custom hand-drawn SVG icons, soft shadows, micro-animations.
- 👥 **Team management** — Invite members, assign roles, online/offline roster, profile avatars.

## Tech

| Layer     | Stack                                                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend   | Node.js + **Fastify** + `ws` WebSockets + sql.js (SQLite WASM) + JWT (HS256) |
| Frontend  | React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS, hand-written SVG icons  |
| Realtime  | Custom pub/sub over native WebSocket                   |
| Storage   | Local `uploads/` directory, SQLite DB in `data/`       |
| Passwords | Argon2-style (bcrypt) hashing with per-user salt       |

## Quick start

```bash
# install deps
npm run install:all

# initialize database (first-run seeds default roles)
npm run db:init

# dev mode: runs api on :8787, web on :5173 (vite proxies /api and /ws to api)
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** and create your first account — it becomes
the workspace **Owner**. Invite teammates from the Team page.

### Production

```bash
npm run build   # compiles frontend into web/dist
npm start       # serves API + built frontend from :8787
```

## Demo credentials

No demo accounts pre-seeded — the first account to register becomes Owner so you
can onboard your team from the Settings / Team page.
